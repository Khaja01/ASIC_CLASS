# VLSI Physical Design for ASICs

## Objective

The objective of VLSI physical design for ASICs is to convert a logical RTL design into a physical layout suitable for fabrication. This process ensures the circuit's functionality aligns with design constraints, performance goals, and manufacturing standards.

## Skill Outcomes

Participants in this course will gain expertise in the following areas:

- **Architectural Design**: Understanding the overall structure and organization of integrated circuits.
- **RTL Design / Behavioral Modeling**: Creating a Register Transfer Level (RTL) description of a digital circuit's behavior.
- **Floorplanning**: The initial phase of physical design where the locations of major components are planned.
- **Placement**: Determining the precise locations of cells or modules on the chip.
- **Clock Tree Synthesis**: Building a clock distribution network to ensure synchronous operation.
- **Routing**: Establishing interconnections between different parts of the design.

## Installation

To get started with the VLSI Physical Design for ASICs workshop, follow these steps:

1. Download the `run.sh` script from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals/blob/master/run.sh).

2. Open a terminal on your system.

3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `run.sh` script. For example, if it's in your Downloads folder, use the following command:

    ```sh
    cd Downloads
    ```

4. Execute the script by running the following command:

    ```sh
    ./run.sh
    ```

This will initiate the installation process and set up the necessary environment for the workshop.
